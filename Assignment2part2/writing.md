# 1: Helping previous you #

If I could travel back in time to previous me I would give the following 
pieces of advice on this project:

1. Make two separate algorithms; one for splitting the string into possible 
   sentences and one for selecting the ones that work of these. Make a 
   greedy program.
2. Start by making it modular in design. If you design one big algorithm 
   first it will become hard to split up into smaller methods.
3. When planning and designing, keep in mind that you'll have to draw a 
   diagram and give up on ideas that would take too long to implement.

# 2: Helping future you #

If I were working in a team as a computer scientist for a company or an 
academic institution I would probably have various requirements that my code 
would have to meet or things it would have to do. Having experience dealing 
with the constraints of engineering requirements will help me to know how to 
work around things that aren't allowed. It will also encourage me to find 
alternative solutions to problems, so that less experienced members of my 
team could still follow the code and the logic for example. In addition, 
having experience changing accessibility requirements on markdown will be 
invaluable if I ever have to present my code or what it does to other team 
members or coworkers, so that anybody with accessibility needs isn't 
excluded. Even without knowing about accessibility requirements, knowing how 
to write a markdown and format it will be useful for explanations, 
presentations, comments, notes, etc. Hence, working around engineering 
requirements, learning markdown and changing the format of a document for 
accessibility are all very useful if I were ever in a software development 
team. 

# 3: You be the judge #

When completing this assignment I should have spent more time choosing my 
challenge so that I chose one that was interesting but not too long. I spent 
excessive amounts of time trying to debug a bad algorithm that I didn't end 
up using and should instead have thought of more ways of solving the problem 
beforehand. That being said however, designing my final solution fully 
before coding was very helpful, as it let me work from the higher levels to the
lower levels of my solution when coding and solve my problems quickly. It also 
made debugging much easier. Starting early was also useful as it let me have 
more time to flesh out my design and then change it. Another step I took 
that was the right thing to do was to chat about the problem with a friend. 
This helped me to understand issues with my code, come up with new 
approaches and see a new take on the problem. 
I feel that writing a first draft of the worksheet wasn't as useful as I 
would have liked. This is because I changed my design to implement enums for 
the summative and so my formative part wasn't as relative. Also seeing how 
the marking scheme worked gave me different priorities that changed what I 
decided to write about in more detail. 
I hope that if I had a selection of worksheets by students mine would stand 
out for it's challenging problem, interesting solution and good explanations.
I would hope that students learning java would read the problem description 
and have their curiosity peaked on how to solve it. Alternatively, a student 
who wanted to learn more of java's features would also hopefully be drawn 
more to my worksheet as they would learn more from it.
