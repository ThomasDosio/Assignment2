# 1: Helping previous you #

If I could travel back in time to previous me I would give the following 
pieces of advice on this project:

1. Make two separate algorithms; one for splitting the string into possible 
   sentences and one for selecting the ones that work of these. Make a 
   greedy program. 
2. Start by making it modular in design. If you design one big algorithm 
   first it will become hard to split up into smaller methods.
3. When planning and designing, keep in mind that you'll have to draw a 
   diagram and give up on ideas that would take too long to implement.

# 2: Helping future you #

If I were working in a team as a computer scientist for a company or an 
academic institution I would probably have various requirements that my code 
would have to meet or things it would have to do. Having experience dealing 
with the constraints of engineering requirements will help me to know how to 
work around things that aren't allowed. It will also encourage me to find 
alternative solutions to problems, so that less experienced members of my 
team could still follow the code and the logic for example. In addition, 
having experience changing accessibility requirements on markdown will be 
invaluable if I ever have to present my code or what it does to other team 
members or coworkers, so that anybody with accessibility needs isn't 
excluded. Even without knowing about accessibility requirements, knowing how 
to write a markdown and format it will be useful for explanations, 
presentations, comments, notes, etc. Hence, working around engineering 
requirements, learning markdown and changing the format of a document for 
accessibility are all very useful if I were ever in a software development 
team. 

# 3: You be the judge #

When completing this assignment there were various parts that I had to do. I 
feel like going through every challenge and choosing whether it was 
interesting, useful and coming up with a design was less useful than I 
thought it would be. This is because I found a challenge I really liked 
early on and I didn't change my mind by reading the later ones. Making more 
than one design for my chosen challenge on the other hand was extremely 
useful. I ended up coding three different designs for this challenge and 
choosing the one that was the easiest to explain, make modular and debug. 
However, having the other designs helped me to come up with this design and 
was a great learning experience.
Drawing a diagram was useful when developing the ideas behind my design and 
so was a useful step to take however to make it useful for the worksheet I 
had to add other parts which was quite time-consuming. Another step that I 
hadn't done before was designing for accessibility. This was a really useufl 
thing to learn in the long term.
Another step I took that was the right thing to do was to chat about the problem
with a friend. This helped me to understand issues with my code, come up with new 
approaches and see a new take on the problem. 
I feel that writing a first draft of the worksheet wasn't as useful as I 
would have liked. This is because I changed my design to implement enums for 
the summative and so my formative part wasn't as relative. Also seeing how 
the marking scheme worked gave me different priorities that changed what I 
decided to write about in more detail. 
I hope that if I had a selection of worksheets by students mine would stand 
out for it's challenging problem, interesting solution and good explanations.
I would hope that students learning java would read the problem description 
and have their curiosity piqued on how to solve it. Alternatively, a student 
who wanted to learn more of java's features would also hopefully be drawn 
more to my worksheet as they would learn more from it. If all else were to 
fail I hope that a prospective reader would see the colourful shapes in my 
diagram and wonder what it was all about.
