# Leave it too late  #

It takes time to:

- assess all the challenges and choose one;
- submit the questionnaire with your choice;
- define your target audience;
- design a solution to suit your target audience;
- explain the design in writing and in a diagram;
- acknowledge your sources properly;
- check your work;
- generate the `zip` file for submission;
- check the `zip` for errors;
- submit your work.

# Think of it only as coding a toy problem #

Other programming courses you have taken probably concentrated solely
on coding small programs. Inf1B is preparing you for proper software
engineering. This involves much more planning and writing. As this is
work in an academic environment, you also need to demonstrate that
learning and understanding are taking place.

# Fail to submit your choice of challenge #

This will probably result in your Part 1 not receiving feedback from
your tutor. If that happens, don't worry. You will still be able to
attend the feedback tutorial and gain feedback there. You will also
still be eligible to submit Part 2 for marks.

# Fail to check your `zip` file is correct before submitting #

`Zip` files that aren't `zip`s or contain the wrong files or contain
an embedded `zip` of an old version will cost you: feedback for
Part&nbsp;1 and marks for Part&nbsp;2. If the file you upload is not
a `zip` it will cost you everything for that part of the assignment
because Gradescope will not show the markers any content.

# Fail to submit Part 1 #

This will definitely result in your Part 1 not receiving feedback from
your tutor. You will still be able to attend the feedback tutorial and
gain feedback there. You will also be eligible to submit Part 2 for
marks. There will be some marks that you will not be eligible for but
you will still have the chance for a decent overall mark.

# Ignore the feedback #

Feedback is intended to show where further improvement can be made. Feedback can
also be reassuring and make you feel more confident about your
capabilities. The assignment is about explaining a design to someone
else, so not analysing others' reactions to your design is inherently
risky.
